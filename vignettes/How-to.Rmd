## Step 1: Set up your Rstudio project

From Rstudio, create a new project - then make sure to install the necessary packages:

[hcrdata](https://unhcr-web.github.io/hcrdata/docs/) to connect to both Kobo & RIDL API

```r
## API to connect to internal data sources
remotes::install_github('unhcr-web/hcrdata’)
```
```r
## Use UNHCR graphical template- https://unhcr-web.github.io/unhcRstyle/docs/
remotes::install_github('unhcr-web/unhcRstyle')
```
```r
## Perform High Frequency Check https://unhcr.github.io/HighFrequencyChecks/docs/
remotes::install_github('unhcr/HighFrequencyChecks’)
```
```r
## Process data crunching for survey dataset - https://unhcr.github.io/koboloadeR/docs/
remotes::install_github('unhcr/koboloadeR’)

```
You can now prepare your project


```r
library (koboloadeR) # This loads koboloadeR package

kobo_projectinit() # Creates folders necessary and transfer files needed
```

This last function creates a structure of folders that is consistent  with R regular package structure

- `R` where processing scripts are stored
- `data-raw` where raw data are stored
- `data` where processed data are kept
- `vignettes` where generated Rmarkdown 
- `out` where generated report (knitted markdown) in word/powerpoint or html are pushed 

## Step 2: get data and form from your Kobo Project


The initial step to start your project is to get your data.

The package is using only `csv` files. this is to avoid the limitations linked the number of columns that some version of excel can handle.

One important point to note is related to the limitation in terms of variable names in R: A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and __starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number__. Names such as ".2way" or "2.way" are not valid, and neither are the reserved words.

In case your original variable names within your xlsform were starting with a number, you will __need to rename manually__ all variable names both in your xlsform and in the data you downloaded.

Below is a step by step guidance on how to generate quickly a fully reproducible analysis

In order to complete this step, you can either:

 * Use the web interface and put the files into the `data-raw` folder

 * pull from API with HCRdata 

Open a new R script within a new RStudio project.

You should then be able to launch the "data browser" within [Rstudio addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_addins.html) menu or with the following command in your console:
```r
hcrdata:::hcrbrowse()
```

From there you will need to:
 1. select the source
 2. go to the dataset tab and select the project you want to pull data from
 3. go to the files tab and select the specific file you want to retrieve from the project.
 4. press the load data button and the R statement to pull this file from your project will be automatically inserted in your blank R script tab

alternatively, if you have the uniqueID of your koboproject: `dataset` and the name of your form file in your project, you could use directly the code below - note that 

```r

## pulling data from Kobo
dataset <-  "dataset-title-in-kobo"
form <- "name-of-the-form.xlsx"

if(!dir_exists("data-raw")) {
  dir_create(path("data-raw"))
  
  
  hcrdata::hcrfetch(src = "kobo", 
                    dataset = dataset, 
                    file = form)
                    
data <-
  hcrdata::hcrfetch(
    src = "kobo",
    dataset = "My kobo project",
    file = "data.json") %>%
  jsonlite::fromJSON() %>%
  purrr::pluck("results") %>%
  tibble::as_tibble() %>%
  purrr::set_names(~stringr::str_replace_all(., "(\\/)", "."))
  
write.csv(data, "data-raw/MainDataFrame.csv", row.names = FALSE)  

}

file.copy(from = paste0("data-raw/",dataset,"/form.xlsx"),
          to   = "data-raw/form.xlsx")


```

__Note__ that for the rest of the process, it is convenient to name your form `form.xlsx` and your downloaded data frame `MainDataFrame.csv`

## Step 3: Prepare your report configuration in xlsform

You need first to make sure that the form is in the xlsx format so that it can be used by the package - if not, open your xls file in LibreOffice or Excel and save it within the right format.

Next step is to extend your xlsform:

```r
## Change here the precise name of the form if required
form <- "form.xlsx" 

## Extend xlsform with required column if necessary - done only once!
#kobo_prepare_form(form)
```

Once the xlsform as been extended, re-open it in your favorite spreadsheet processing software 

### in survey Worksheet

 *  Relabel by adjusting the field `labelReport` for both the questions in `survey` and the question modalities in `choice` worksheet. Note that label for questions should be less than 80 characters long and modalities should be less than 40 characters.

#### Fill `report` and  `chapter`
 
#### Document `disaggregation`,	`correlate` and `variable`

 * `disaggregation`: used to flag variables used to  `facet` dataset 
 * `correlate`: used to flag variables used for  statistical test of independence (for categorical variable) or correlation for numeric variable
 * `variable`: used to flag `ordinal` variables so that graphs are not ordered per frequency.

#### Document `clean`
 

A well-designed and tested survey should allow to minimise data cleaning issues. Specifically unconsistent answers can be anticipated and avoided through a series of well set-up constraints. You can learn more on [questionnaire design here](https://unhcr.github.io/Integrated-framework-household-survey/Configure-forms.html) 

However even with the best designed questionnaires, there will still be some issues to fix

Survey data cleaning may involves different steps:

##### Remove Records

 identifying and removing responses from individuals who either don’t match the target audience criteria or did not answer your questions thoughtfully. In case of self-administered questionnaire online, there might be also issues called “speeders” and “flat-liners” (respondents expediting the questionnaire), in such situation, date/time stamp on questions or group of questions can help identifying the records to be removed 

##### Adjust closed question from open-end answers

Often some people will tend to use this last _other_ options to enter information. The result is an open ended question that is very difficult to analyse. 
Re-encoding certains __select_one__ _list_name_ __or_other__ variables is therefore quite often a necessary step. 

Koboloader has some functions to handle this situation

  *  `kobo_cleanlog(form) `

  *  `kobo_clean(frame, dico)` 

Insert a column named clean and reference the csv file to use for cleaning. 
 
 
#### Document `cluster`

 
#### Document `anonymise`	
 
 
 
### in Choice Worksheet


### in analysisSetting Worksheet





## Step 4: Prepare your analysis post 

### Document the data and push it from kobo to RIDL

You have now done the biggest part of the work. You can already push some of those document to the data repository. The standard for this is [UNHCR Raw Internal Data Library - RIDL](https://gridl.unhcr.org), which is based [CKAN servers](https://ckan.org/), the same software being used for [HDX - The Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/). More

### Prepare material for Joint Data Interpretation 

Once you have generated all potential markdown files, you will end with a lot of visuals. Therefore it is key to carefully select the most relevant visual that will be presented for interpretation. In order to keep participant focused, a typical __joint data interpretation session__ shall not last more than 2 hours and include not more than 60 visuals/slide.

You can create an empty markdown using the `unhcRstyle::unhcr_templ_ppt` powerpoint template and copy/paste within this new file the most relevant charts.
 
In order to guide this selection phase, the data crunching expert and report designer, in collaboration with the data analysis group, can use the following elements:
 
  *  For numeric value, check the frequency distributions of each variable to average, deviation, including outliers and oddities
 
  *  For categorical variables, check for unexpected values: any weird results based on common sense expectations
 
  *  Use correlation analysis to check for potential contradictions in respondents answers to different questions for identified associations (chi-square)
 
  *  Always, Check for missing data (NA) or "%of respondent who answered" that you cannot confidently explain
 
  *  Check unanswered questions, that corresponds to unused skip logic in the questionnaire: For instance, did a person who was never displaced answer displacement-related questions? Were employment-related answers provided for a toddler?
 
### Take notes during the joint data interpretation session 

Before the session, you need to agree in advance on the __note-taker role__. That person may potential write the notes directly within the markdown file. 
 
When analyzing those representations in a collective setting during data interpretation sessions, you may:  
 
  *  __Reflect__: question data quality and/or make suggestions to adjust questions, identify additional cleaning steps;   

  *  __Interpret__: develop qualitative interpretations of data patterns;     

  *  __Recommend__: suggest recommendations in terms of programmatic adjustment;    

  *  __Classify__: define level of sensitivity for certain topics if required.

 

### Write the final markdown




## Step 5: Peer review your analysis post through the Internal Analysis Repository

Peer Review is essential to produce good analysis. Such peer review is performed through the submission of your Rmd files to your data analysis focal point in the Regional Bureau.

Before submitting your markdown files, plug them directly to the correct RIDl container with the following code chunk

```r

## pulling data from RIDL
dataset <-  "dataset-title-in-rild"

if(!dir_exists("data-raw")) {
  dir_create(path("data-raw"))
  
  
  hcrdata::hcrfetch(src = "ridl", 
                    dataset = dataset, 
                    file = "form.xls",
                    #path= here::here("data-raw",  file),
                    cache = TRUE)
hcrdata::hcrfetch(src = "ridl", 
                  dataset = dataset, 
                  file = "maindataframe.csv",
                    #path= here::here("data-raw",  file),
                    cache = TRUE)

}

file.copy(from = paste0("data-raw/",dataset,"/form.xls"),
          to   = "data-raw/form.xls")

file.copy(from = paste0("data-raw/",dataset,"/maindataframe.csv"),
          to   = "data-raw/MainDataFrame.csv")


if(!dir_exists("data")) {
  dir_create(path("data"))
  
    if(!dir_exists("R")) {
      dir_create(path("R"))
      
      form <- "form.xls"
      koboloadeR::kobo_load_data()
    
    }
}
```
